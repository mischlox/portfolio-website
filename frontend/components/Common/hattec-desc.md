## Focus Areas
The role involved developing and integrating modular C++/Python components for sensor and image processing systems running on Linux. **ROS2** was used to structure and manage the distributed data flow between sensors and processing algorithms.

Simultaneously, I focused on specialized on **tiny object detection**, managing the full lifecycle from training and data annotation to deploying optimized State-of-the-Art models on target hardware.

## Key Contributions and Achievements

* **Object Detection Pipeline:** Designed, trained, and deployed optimized **State-of-the-Art Tiny Object Detection** models (e.g., for aircraft recognition) tailored for specific sensor data and domain constraints.
* **Data and Annotation:** Managed, annotated, and augmented custom datasets to support the training and validation of computer vision models.
* **Sensor Processing:** Developed modular **C++ and Python components** using **ROS2** applications for efficient processing and analysis of various sensor data streams.
* **Refactoring and Optimization:** Conducted major **refactoring** of existing software modules to significantly improve performance, reduce latency, and increase long-term maintainability.
* **Cross-Platform Deployment:** Integrated and tested software components on diverse target systems, including **ARM (Jetson), x86**, and custom hardware, managing hardware connection and interfacing.
* **Quality Assurance:** Implemented robust and automated testing frameworks using **GoogleTest (C++)** and **PyTest (Python)** to ensure code reliability and system stability.
