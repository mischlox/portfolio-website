## Program Profile

Interdisciplinary Master’s program in **Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence**, combining **Informatics** with **Electrical and Mechanical Engineering**. The program focuses on intelligent robotic systems that perceive, learn, and act autonomously, with strong emphasis on **AI-driven perception**, **learning-based decision making**, and **human-robot interaction** in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving.

## Core Expertise and Skills Acquired

I developed a solid theoretical and practical foundation in robotics and intelligent systems, with a clear specialization in perception and learning:

* **Computer Vision & Perception:** Autonomous driving perception, multi-view geometry and 3D reconstruction, object detection, segmentation, and tracking.
* **Sensor Data Processing:** Sensor fusion and image-based perception for autonomous systems.
* **Machine Learning & AI:** Mathematical foundations of machine learning, including optimization, probability, and statistical learning theory, along with supervised and unsupervised methods.
* **Real-Time Systems:** Timing constraints, scheduling, and reliability in safety-critical systems, complemented by parallel and concurrent programming concepts for performance-critical applications.
* **Robotics & Control:** Classical robotics, kinematics, sensing, and system integration.

## Professional Orientation

Prepared for research and industry roles in **robotics**, **autonomous driving**, and **intelligent systems**, with applications across automotive, aerospace, medical technology, and consumer electronics.
